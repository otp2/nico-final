Next Steps for When You Return:
Based on our work, here are some logical next steps:
Create Content Pages: The navigation links (/about, /about/experience, /expertise/advisory, /library/publications, /contact, etc.) currently don't lead anywhere. You'll need to create the corresponding page files (e.g., src/app/about/page.tsx, src/app/expertise/advisory/page.tsx) and populate them with the actual content.
Build Out Components: Create components for specific content types (e.g., a PublicationCard, CaseStudySummary, ExperienceTimeline) to use on the content pages.
Contact Page Functionality: Implement the /contact page, potentially adding a contact form (which would likely require backend logic or a third-party service like Formspree, Resend, etc.).
Refine Hero Section: Update the text "Another component from Craft UI" in src/components/hero.tsx to something more relevant. Replace the placeholder link on "Nico Abuaf" if needed.
Footer: Add a site footer, perhaps in src/app/layout.tsx or as a separate component.
Responsiveness & Testing: Thoroughly test the site on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure layouts are consistent and usable.
Accessibility (A11y): Perform an accessibility audit. Ensure images have meaningful alt text, interactive elements are keyboard-navigable, and color contrast is sufficient.
SEO: Add proper metadata (titles, descriptions) to each page in layout.tsx or page.tsx files for better search engine visibility.
Deployment: Set up deployment via Vercel (as mentioned in the README) or another hosting provider.
